            In our daily life, we are working with multiple applications and creating different passwords for each one. But did you ever forgot your passwords?
            And ever thought of saving passwords? We will think right?.. Now, its solved. I have create an desktop application for storing all your passwords, urls, usernames
            at one place. Here, why it is a desktop application is because passwords are sensitive information and I not wanted them to propagate over the network.
            So, In this application,I am storing those data in your local system user folder as a JSON file and presenting you a nice UI to interact with the passwords.
            <br/>
            By using this application we can directly copy paste the data in the fields, it can be urls, usernames or passwords.
            Even while you are sharing your screen, you can copy paste the passwords from this application without disclosing as the fields are masked.
            Its sounds good right. Download the application and if you find useful & share with your friends.
            <br/>
